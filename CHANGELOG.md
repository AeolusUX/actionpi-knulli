# Release and development milestones

These are curated milestones, not a fabricated historical Git commit log.
Version numbers are adaptation checkpoints, not upstream KNULLI versions.

| Checkpoint | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| v87 baseline | Known bootable starting point; preserve it while testing Wi-Fi |
| v92–v114 experiments | Boot failures/freezes and incorrect Wi-Fi assumptions; not release recommendations |
| v115 | Personal stable checkpoint with working Wi-Fi, audio and RetroArch |
| v116, 2026-10-22 | Guarded display-client cleanup kernel repair; later Mali/Vulkan and presentation trials |
| 2026-10-23 integration | Correct scanout opacity/rotation, input, persistent settings; Mali menu and same-boot PSP round trips |
| v117 / v118 | Withdrawn because brightness inversion/polarity handling was incomplete |
| v119, 2026-10-24 | Cold boot and suspend/wake brightness correction confirmed; owner confirmed installed stable image |
| v119 Distribution Edition | Public defaults, personal BIOS archive removed, base BIOS retained, private data cleanup; PortMaster rotation added |
| v119 Distribution r2 / personal v120 r2 | ES Emulators/PPSSPP standalone entry routed through the existing Vulkan supervisor; no ROM required; owner confirmed output and menu return |
| Personal v120 | Private successor to personal v119, including BIOS/settings and PortMaster fix; not a public asset |

The public asset is named **v119 Distribution Edition** because it was packaged
from that confirmed public baseline. Its PortMaster follow-up is included even
though the original personal v119 IMG predates that follow-up. Personal v119 was
subsequently removed from the current personal stable list; this does not rename
or withdraw the separate public distribution asset.
